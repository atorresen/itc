			<h2>course description</h2>
			<p>This course introduces artists and designers to computation as a creative medium.
			Using the web-focused coding languages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we will
			learn basic computational methods and structures. By the end of the course,
			students will be able to design web pages and digital graphics from scratch
			and will be able to use computational thinking as a tool in their existing
			artistic practices.</p>
		</div>

		<hr>

		<div id="topics">
			<h2>topics covered</h2>
			<p>The course will provide an introduction to key coding concepts, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em>variables</em> – name things, store values, generalize</li>
				<li><em>conditionals</em> – “if this, then that” branching logic</li>
				<li><em>recursion</em> – inputs, outputs, and iterative computational processes</li>
				<li><em>modularity</em> – organize complexity into reusable parts</li>
				<li><em>full stack development</em> – front end, back end, publishing</li>
			</ul>

			<p>We will also practice habits of computational thinking
				(especially as related to creative processes), including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em>debugging</em> – persevering with systematic problem-solving techniques</li>
				<li><em>documentation</em> – writing clear, legible, reusable code</li>
				<li><em>self-reference</em> – reflecting on your artistic practice as part of your artistic practice</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div id="assignments">
			<h2>assignments</h2>
			<p>
				Students will complete and document a new project each week.
				Prompts for the projects are proposed below. These prompts may
				be considered as open invitations, to be taken literally or to
				be adjusted to your own interests. A submission is due every week,
				but you are encouraged to work on the prompts whenever you are
				inspired to do so. You may choose to respond to the same prompt
				multiple times.
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<h5>getting to know you</h5>
					Create or improve your personal website	using HTML and CSS,
					then publish it using Github.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<h5>one if by hand, two if by C++</h5>
					Define a thing to make/do. Do it entirely by hand. Then, do it
					again using coding tools. (Or vice versa.)
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<h5>strange loops</h5>
					Do a project about a coding concept using a coding structure
					related to the concept.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<h5>if there was a problem, yo, I’ll solve it</h5>
					What project are you working on that you want to find a computational
					solution for? Introduce the topics/tools from this course in an
					existing project.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li><h5>final project</h5> Make something you love.</li>
			</ol>

			<hr>

			<h2>submissions</h2>
			<p>
				All projects and exercises will be published to your GitHub repository
				for Intro to Computation. We will set up GitHub in class, which we will
				use as a tool for publishing work on the web (a critical part of the
				web design and development process).
			</p>
			<p>
				Once your work is published, you must submit it before class begins on the due date
				by posting a link to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.are.na/annemarie-torresen/submissions-itc-w26">
				class Are.na channel</a>.

		<div id="grading">
			<h2>grading</h2>
			<p>
				Your grade will reflect your engagement with computational thinking through
				creative practice. In the words of Edgar Allen Poe (The Poetic Principle, 1850),
				the best works “breathe an earnestness — an evident sincerity of sentiment.”
				In other words, if you are genuinely interested in what you are doing,
				then you are on the right track.
			</p>

			<h3>grade breakdown:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					weekly projects (60%): submissions that fulfill the evaluation criteria listed below
				</li>
				<li>
					participation, reflection and critique (40%): thoughtful reflections on
					your own work and the work of your classmates; engagement during class
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>evaluation criteria:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>resourcefulness: How creatively do you solve problems and find help?</li>
				<li>risk-taking: Do you experiment beyond comfort zones?</li>
				<li>computational integration: Are you thinking with variables, loops, conditionals, etc.?</li>
				<li>documentation: Can others understand what you made and why?</li>
				<li>collaborative learning: Do you help others and seek help when needed?</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>what grades mean:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A: consistent experimental making, takes creative risks, fluent computational thinking,
					frequently contributes to class discussions, submits work on time
				</li>
				<li>
					B: regular making with some computational concepts integrated, contributes to
					class discussions, submits work on time
				</li>
				<li>
					C: completes basic requirements, shows effort but limited integration of
					concepts, minimal contributions to discussions
				</li>
				<li>
					Below: inconsistent work, missing or late assignments, minimal computational
					thinking, not engaged in discussions
				</li>

		<div id="expectations">
			<h2>classroom expectations</h2>

			<h3>participation</h3>
			<p>
				Please arrive on time to every class and participate actively in
				discussions and other group activities. I (AnneMarie) want you to
				want to be here!
			</p>
			<p>
				We will follow <a target="_blank" href="https://risd.coursedog.com/academic-policies/student-records/absence-policy">
				RISD's attendance policy</a> (multiple unexcused absences will result in
				a failing grade). If you need to be absent or participate remotely, please
				<a href="mailto:atorre03@risd.edu">email AnneMarie</a> as soon as possible.
				Open communication is key.
			</p>

			<br>

			<h3>growth mindset</h3>
			<p>
				The coding process is inherently experimental. Expect to be confused,
				surprised, and occasionally frustrated - this is where learning happens.
				In this class, we will value curiosity, resourcefulness, helping each
				other, and taking creative risks over getting things "right."
				We all are always learning.
			</p>

			<br>

			<h3>respect</h3>
			<p>
				Software development and other STEM fields have historically excluded
				disadvantaged groups (
				<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">despite</a>
				<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Johnson">their</a>
				<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Vaughan">essential</a>
				<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Jackson_(engineer)">contributions</a>
				<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">to</a>
				<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Ellis_(computer_scientist)">the</a>
				<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Clay">field</a>
				).
				In this class, we must commit to creating an inclusive space where
				different backgrounds, ideas, and approaches to computational thinking
				strengthen our collective learning.
			</p>

			<br>

			<h3>a note on AI</h3>
			<p>
				Assignments are designed to help you <em>develop computational skills,</em>
				not to find a “right” answer. It is up to you, the student, to make sure
				that you are thinking deeply about whatever you want to learn.
			</p>
			<p>
				While the use of AI tools is not forbidden in this course, you are
				encouraged to limit your use of these tools. <em>Always attempt to solve a
				problem on your own first</em>, before consulting AI. Per RISD’s
				Academic code of Conduct (linked below) you must <em>always acknowledge
				your use of AI tools with a formal citation</em>, and reflect on the impact
				of AI on a) your work, and b) your understanding of your work.

		<h3>land acknowledgement</h3>
		<p>
			Rhode Island School of Design is built on what is now called College Hill,
			part of the ancestral homelands of the Narragansett Nation. Indigenous people
			from many nations—near and far—live, study and work in Providence today.
			The amplification of Native voices and histories is crucial to rectifying
			the many violent legacies of colonialism, and we gratefully acknowledge
			the ongoing critical contributions of Indigenous people across our state,
			region and nation.
