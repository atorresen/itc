		<!-- comments in HTML look like this -->
		<!-- you can quickly comment out a line of code by hitting COMMAND + / -->
		<!-- text that is commented out does not appear on the web -->
		<!-- it is good practice to write comments that describe what your code is doing -->
		<!-- also use comments to mark questions or things still left TODO -->

		<!-- link to Wikipedia -->

		<!-- the <br> tag creates a line break -->
		<br>

		<!-- insert an image using its url -->
		<!-- if a line of code is so long that it requires you to scroll to the righ to read it... -->
		<!-- ... it is best practice to split it into multiple lines (just not within a "string") -->
